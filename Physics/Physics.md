### Physics

The word **Physics** originates from the Greek word *physikḗ* (Physica), which means nature.  

> **Physics is the natural science that studies matter, its fundamental constituents, its motion, its behaviour through space and time and the related entities of energy and force. The main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves.**  

Simply put, it observes nature, represents it mathematically and concludes with the experiment.

Physics is the foundation of all other sciences. The laws of physics govern everything in the Universe from molecules to planets and stars.

### Physical Quantity

> Physical quantity is a physical property of a phenomenon, body or substance that can be quantified by measurement.  

A physical quantity can be expressed as the combination of a magnitude expressed by a number - usually a real number and a standard unit. For example, the physical quantity mass can be quantified as n kg, where n is the numerical value and kg is the unit.

<br>

#### There are two types of physical quantities

<br>

1. Base Quantities

**The seven base quantities and their corresponding units are:**

Base Quantity | Base Unit | Symbol
:--|:--:|:--:
Time | second | s
Length | meter | m
Mass | kilogram | kg
Electric Current | ampere | A
Thermodynamic temperature | Kelvin | K
Amount of substance | mole | mol
Luminous Intensity | candela | cd


2. Derived Quantities

### SI Units

 > SI Units are internationally recognized units used by all scientists and used to define certain concepts. The seven base units are listed above.

<summary>Scalars</summary>
<br>

---

### Scalar Quantity

> Physical quantities which have magnitude only and do not depend on direction are called Scalars.

<br>  

- Scalar quantities are usually represented by a real number(magnitude) and a unit with its symbol.
- The Scalars can be compared only when they have same physical dimension(units).
- Operations with scalars such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division follow the basic rules of elementry algebra.

<br>  

**Mass, speed, distance, volume** and **temperature** are some examples of scalars.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Vectors</summary>
<br>

---

### Vector Quantity

> Physical quantities that possess both magnitude and direction and whose operations obey the axioms of vector space are known as vectors.  

<br>

- Vectors are written in capital letters A, B, C with an arrow above them which represents their  direction.
- The magnitude of vectors are denoted by |A|, |B|, |C| or are simply written in _italic_.

<br>

**Velocity, acceleration, displacement, force and momentum are some examples of vectors.**

### Distance [s]

> Distance is defined as **the magnitude or amount of space(length) between two points, without any regard to direction. We can define distance as to how much ground an object has covered during its motion despite its starting or ending point.**

Distance is the magnitude of displacement between two positions.

Note that the distance between two positions is not the same as the distance traveled between them. Distance traveled is the total length of the path traveled between two positions.

Distance is a scalar quantity as it only depends upon the magnitude and not the direction. Distance has no direction and, thus, no sign. For example, the distance a man walks is 2.0 meter. The distance the airplane passenger walks is 4.0 meter.


- Distance is scalar
- The SI Unit of distance is meter(m). The basic unit of distance is the centimeter (cm). There are 100 centimeters in a meter and 1000 meters in a kilometer.
- Dimension = ""
- Distance is always positive.

> **d** = **√ (x<sub>2</sub>** - **x<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup>** + **(y<sub>2</sub>** - **y<sub>1</sub>)**<sup>2</sup>

- **d** = distance
- **(x<sub>1</sub>** - **y<sub>1</sub>)** = coordinates of the first point
- **(x<sub>2</sub>** - **y<sub>2</sub>)** = coordinates of the second point

OR

> **Distance** = **Speed** x **Time**
> **d** = **s**.**t**
> where _s_ stands for distance or displacement, _v_ for speed or velocity and t for time.

<details>
<summary>Distance Traveled</summary>
<br>

---

### Distance Traveled

> The total length of the path traveled between two positions.

It is important to note that the distance traveled, however, can be greater than the magnitude of the displacement (by magnitude, we mean just the size of the displacement without regard to its direction; that is, just a number with a unit). For example, the professor could pace back and forth many times, perhaps walking a distance of 150 meter during a lecture, yet still end up only 2.0 meter to the right of her starting point. In this case her displacement would be +2.0 meter, the magnitude of her displacement would be 2.0 m, but the distance she traveled would be 150 meter.

<summary>Displacement</summary>
<br>

---

### Displacement [s]

> The change of position of a body in a particular direction is called its displacement. It is the shortest distance between two points with regard of direction.

By definition it is a vector quantity. If a body moves from a position A to another position B, we can represent its displacement by drawing a line from A to B. The direction of displacement can be shown by puttin an arrow head at B, which indicates the direction of displacement.

Displacement **Δx** is the difference between the final position and the initial position of an object. In symbols, displacement **Δx** is defined to be  

> **Δx** = **x<sub>f</sub>** - **x<sub>i</sub>**

- <b>Δx</b> is the symbol used to represent displacement. The Greek letter **Δ**(delta) always means “change in” whatever quantity follows it.
- <b>x<sub>f</sub></b> refers to the value of the final position
- <b>x<sub>i</sub></b> refers to the value of the initial position

<br>

Displacement is a vector. This means it has a direction as well as a magnitude and is represented visually as an arrow that points from the initial position to the final position.

- Displacement is a vector quantity.
- The SI Unit of displacement is meter(m).
- Dimension = ""
- Displacement can be positive or negative

<summary>Speed</summary>
<br>

---

### Speed

> The rate of change of position of an object with respect to time. Speed refers to how fast an object is moving.

Speed is measured as the ratio of distance to the time in which the distance was covered. It is a scalar quantity so it tells us only the magnitude and does not specify direction.

Thus, if you travel 12 miles in 3 hours, the average speed is 4 miles per hour (mi/hr or mph)

- Speed is a scalar quantity
- The SI Unit of speed is meters per second(m/s)
- Other common units of speed are kilometers per hour(km/h) and miles per hour(mph or mi/h)
- Dimension = **M<sup>0</sup>L<sup>1</sup>T<sup>-1</sup>**
- Speed is always positive.
- Speed is absolute value of velocity |v|

#### Formula

The formula of speed is:

> **Speed** = **Distance** / **Time**
> **s** = **d** / **t**  

Where _**s**_ is the speed in meters per second (_**ms<sup>-1</sup>**_  / **_m/s_**), **d** is the distance traveled in meters(_**m**_) and **_t_** is the time taken in seconds(_**s**_).

<details>
<summary>Types of Speed</summary>
<br>

---

**Uniform speed**: Whenever an item travels the same distance in equivalent time intervals, it is said to be moving at a uniform pace.  

**Variable speed**: Whenever an item travels a varied distance at equivalent time intervals, it is said to be moving at a variable speed.  

**Average speed**: It is defined as uniform speed, which is represented by the proportion of an entity's total distance traveled versus the total time taken. Average speed is the distance traveled divided by the time interval.   

**Instantaneous speed**: The speed of an item at any point in time has been referred to as instantaneous speed.

### Velocity [v]


> Velocity is defined as **The rate of change of an object's position with respect to a frame of reference and time in particular direction.**

_OR_

> The rate of change of displacement of a body in a particular direction with respect to time.

Velocity is basically speeding in a specific direction. It tells us not only how fast an object is moving but also the direction in which it is moving. It is a vector quantity, which means we need both magnitude (speed) and direction to define velocity.

- It is a vector quantity
- It is denoted by **v**  
- The SI Unit of velocity is meter per second(**m/s** or **ms-1**)
- The dimension of velocity are LT<sup>-1</sup> or M<sup>0</sup>L<sup>1</sup>T<sup>-1</sup>
- Velocity can be positive or negative. The sign implies the direction of the displacement.


#### Formula

> **Velocity** = **Displacement** / **Time**  
> **v** = **d** / **t**  

Velocity is vector and speed is scalar and thus velocity has a direction but speed does not.  
So essentially, Speed + Direction = Velocity.

<summary>Average Velocity</summary>
<br>

---

#### Average Velocity

> Average velocity is defined as the change in position or average total displacement (**∆x**) of an object over time.

_OR_

> Average velocity is defined as the change in position or displacement (**∆x**) of an object divided by the time intervals (**∆t**) in which the displacement occurs.

The average velocity can be positive or negative depending upon the sign of the displacement. The SI unit of average velocity is meters per second (m/s or ms<sup>-1</sup>). It is a vector quantity.

To calculate the average velocity, we need to divide the total displacement by the total time elapsed as follows:

> Average Velocity = Total Displacement / Time Interval  
> **v** = **∆x** / **∆t** = **x<sub>f</sub>** - **x<sub>i</sub>** / **t<sub>f</sub>** - **t<sub>i</sub>**

Where v is the average velocity, **Δd** is the displacement, **Δt** is the total time, **x<sub>f</sub>** and **x<sub>i</sub>** are the initial and final positions, **t<sub>f</sub>** and **t<sub>i</sub>** are the starting and ending times.

If the starting time is zero, then the formula becomes:

> **v** = **∆x** / **t**

<summary>Instantaneous Velocity</summary>
<br>

---

#### Instantaneous Velocitys

> The velocity of an object under motion at a specific point of time is called instantaneous velocity.

#### Formula

> **V<sub>int</sub>** = _Limit<sub>Δt→0</sub>_ **Δx** / **Δt** = **dx** / **dt**  

Where **V<sub>int</sub>** is the instantaneous velocity of the body, **Δt** the small-time interval, **x** the displacement variable, **t** the time and **Limit<sub>Δt→0</sub>** shows that the time is very small that both **Δx** and **Δt** approach to zero.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Uniform Velocity</summary>
<br>

---

#### Uniform Velocity

> When a body moves equal displacement in equal interval of time in a specified direction then the velocity is known as uniform velocity.

when your velocity is constant, we simply say ‘you are moving at uniform velocity’.
If we draw a graph between time and displacement, then for uniform velocity we obtain a straight line.

Whenever the average and instantaneous velocities are equal, the body is said to have a uniform velocity.
That is, a body is said to have uniform velocity if it travels equal distances in equal intervals of time in a given direction however the small interval may be.  

#### Examples

- Movement of hands of a watch
- Pendulum of clock
- The rotation of the Moon around the earth

<details>
<summary>Non-Uniform Velocity</summary>
<br>

---

#### Variable Velocity or Non-Uniform Velocity

> Velocity of a body is said to be variable or non-uniform if it does not travels equal distance in equal interval of time.

If we draw a graph between time and displacement then for uniform velocity we obtain a non-straight line or curves.

If the direction of motion changes, it is said to be moving with a non-uniform or variable velocity. e.g. a revolving fan at a constant speed has variable velocity.

<summary>Initial and Final Velocity</summary>
<br>

---

#### Initial Velocity [u]

> Initial velocity is the velocity of an object just before a change in speed or acceleration

#### Final Velocity [v]

> Final velocity is the velocity which the body has at the end of the given time period.

In general, the starting and ending velocity will be equal when the average acceleration is equal to zero.

#### Speed vs Velocity

Speed and velocity can be a little confusing for most of us. Well, the difference between speed and velocity is that speed gives us an idea of how fast an object is moving whereas velocity not only tells us its speed but also tells us the direction the body is moving in. We can define speed as a function of distance traveled whereas velocity is a function of displacement. Instantaneous velocity is the velocity of a body at any given time. Average velocity is the total displacement by total time and is given by **v** = **∆x**/**∆t** where **∆x** is the total displacement of the body and **∆t** is the time. Average velocity is always less than or equal to that of average speed; this is because displacement can never be higher than the distance traveled but the distance traveled can be higher than that of displacement.

<summary>Acceleration</summary>
<br>

### Acceleration

> The rate of change of velocity over time is called acceleration. When velocity changes, acceleration exists.

If there is a change in magnitude or the direction in the velocity of a body the body is said to be accelerating. By definition acceleration is a vector quantity. 

If the object is speeding up, the velocity and acceleration will have same signs or else they will be speeding in negative direction or decelerating.

Acceleration is any change in the state of motion. There are 3 basic ways to change your state of motion:

1. Increase your speed
2. Decrease your speed
3. Change your direction

Accelerations are produced by forces. You cannot have an acceleration without a net force present, and transversely you cannot have a net force without producing an acceleration.

#### Formula

> **Acceleration** = **Change in Velocity** / **Time**  
> **a** = **v<sub>f</sub>** - **v<sub>i</sub>** / **t**

- Acceleration is a vector quantity.
- The SI Unit of acceleration is _m/s<sup>2</sup>_
- Dimension = LT<sup>-2</sup> or M<sup>0</sup>L<sup>1</sup>T<sup>-2</sup>
- Acceleration can be positive or negative.

If the velocity is decreasing the acceleration is negative. The negative acceleration is also known as retardation or deceleration.

The motion of a freely falling body under gravity is an example of an uniformly accelerated motion.

> **a**_<sub>ins</sub>_ = _Limit<sub>Δt→0</sub>_ **Δv** / **Δt** = **dv** / **dt**  

Where **a**_<sub>ins</sub>_ is the instantaneous acceleration of the body, **Δv** the small-time interval, **t** the time and _Limit<sub>Δt→0</sub>_ shows that the time is very small that both **Δv** and **Δt** approach to zero.

<summary>Gravitational Acceleration</summary>
<br>

---

at earth
g = -9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>

at moon
g = -1.62 m/s<sup>2</sup>

Acceleration due to gravity is the rate at which an changes its velocity due to the force of gravity.  All objects dropped from the same spot will hit the ground in the same amount of time, regardless of mass.  On Earth, the average acceleration due to gravity is -9.81 m/s2.  Objects that do not hit the ground at the same time are experiencing air resistance, a frictional force that slows objects down.  Reducing the air resistance by changing the shape of the object can accomplish this.

The acceleration due to gravity is ALWAYS negative.  Any object affected only by gravity (a projectile or an object in free fall) has an acceleration of -9.81 m/s2, regardless of the direction.  The acceleration is negative when going up because the speed is decreasing.  The acceleration is negative when going down because it is moving in the negative direction, down.  Even at the top of the path where the instantaneous speed is 0 m/s, the acceleration is still -9.81 m/s2.

Whenever a problem mentions an object is "in free fall," "falling," "thrown, "tossed," or any other synonym, the constant value of acceleration due to gravity is assumed.  If the equation has a in it, like v = v0 + at, the acceleration is negative.  If the equation has g in it, like W = mg, direction is implied and the acceleration is positive.

-10 m/s2 is an acceptable number to use for most calculations in problems, but -9.81 is the more accurate number.
