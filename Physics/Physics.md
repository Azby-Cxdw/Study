### Physics

The word **Physics** originates from the Greek word *physikḗ* (Physica), which means nature.  

> **Physics is the natural science that studies matter, its fundamental constituents, its motion, its behaviour through space and time and the related entities of energy and force. The main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves.**  

Simply put, it observes nature, represents it mathematically and concludes with the experiment.

### Physical Quantity

> Physical quantity is a physical property of a phenomenon, body or substance that can be quantified by measurement.  

A physical quantity can be expressed as the combination of a magnitude expressed by a number - usually a real number and a standard unit.

<br>

#### There are two types of physical quantities

<br>

1. Base Quantities

2. Derived Quantities

<summary>Scalars</summary>
<br>

### Scalar Quantity

> Physical quantities which have magnitude only and do not depend on direction are called Scalars.

<br>  

- Scalar quantities are usually represented by a real number(magnitude) and a unit with its symbol.
- The Scalars can be compared only when they have same physical dimension(units).
- Operations with scalars such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division follow the basic rules of elementry algebra.

<br>  

**Mass, speed, distance, volume and temperature are some examples of scalars.**

<summary>Vectors</summary>
<br>

### Vector Quantity

> Physical quantities that possess both magnitude and direction and whose operations obey the axioms of vector space are known as vectors.  

<br>

- Vectors are written in capital letters A, B, C with an arrow above them which represents their  direction.
- The magnitude of vectors are denoted by |A|, |B|, |C| or are simply written in *italic*.

<br>

**Velocity, acceleration, displacement, force and momentum are some examples of vectors.**

<summary>Distance</summary>
<br>

### Distance [s]

> Distance is defined as **the magnitude or amount of space between two points, without any regard to direction. We can define distance as to how much ground an object has covered despite its starting or ending point.**

Note that the distance between two positions is not the same as the distance traveled between them. Distance traveled is the total length of the path traveled between two positions.

Distance is a scalar quantity as it only depends upon the magnitude and not the direction. Distance has no direction and, thus, no sign. For example, the distance a man walks is 2.0 meter. The distance the airplane passenger walks is 4.0 meter.


- Distance is scalar
- Dimension = ""

Distance (d) = √ (x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + (y<sub>2</sub> - y<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup>

<summary>Distance Traveled</summary>
<br>

### Distance Traveled

> The total length of the path traveled between two positions.

It is important to note that the distance traveled, however, can be greater than the magnitude of the displacement (by magnitude, we mean just the size of the displacement without regard to its direction; that is, just a number with a unit). For example, the professor could pace back and forth many times, perhaps walking a distance of 150 meter during a lecture, yet still end up only 2.0 meter to the right of her starting point. In this case her displacement would be +2.0 meter, the magnitude of her displacement would be 2.0 m, but the distance she traveled would be 150 meter.

<summary>Displacement</summary>
<br>

### Displacement

> Displacement is defined to be the change in position of an object in any specific direction.
The shorted distance between two points in a specific direction.

It can be defined mathematically with the following equation:

**Displacement** = **Δx** = **x<sub>f</sub>** - **x<sub>i</sub>**

- <b>Δx</b> is the symbol used to represent displacement
- <b>x<sub>f</sub></b> refers to the value of the final position
- <b>x<sub>i</sub></b> refers to the value of the initial position

<br>

Displacement is a vector. This means it has a direction as well as a magnitude and is represented visually as an arrow that points from the initial position to the final position.

- Displacement is a vector quantity.
- Dimension = ""
